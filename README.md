Testbed for visualization of 2D LiDAR for 3D VR applications using Unity 6000.0.29f1

Goals:
- Parse rosbag data from ROS LiDAR controller running on Rasberry PI
- Create a 3D virtual environment that renders 2D LiDAR data as 3D objects
- Create system that updates environment in realtime as LiDAR data is passed into Unity
- (Possible?) Use Unity to keep track of previous LiDAR data and build rough virtual environment that the robot can use for autonomous navigation
